        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>In attribute-based searchable encryption (ABSE) scheme, data owners can encrypt their data
with access policy for security consideration, and encrypt keywords to obtain keyword index for privacy
keyword search, and data users can search interesting keyword on keyword indexes by keyword search
trapdoor. However, many existing searchable encryption schemes only support single keyword search and
most of the existing attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes have high computational costs at user client.
These problems signicantly limit the application of attribute-based searchable encryption schemes in
practice. In this paper, we propose a veriable and multi-keyword searchable attribute-based encryption
(VMKS-ABE) scheme for cloud storage, in our new scheme, multi-keyword can be searched and the search
privacy is protected. That is, the cloud server can search the multi-keyword with keyword search trapdoor but
it does not know any information about the keywords searched. In the proposed scheme, many computing
tasks are outsourced to the cloud proxy server, which greatly reduces the computing burden at the user client.
Besides, the scheme also supports the verication of the correctness of the outsourced private key. The
proposed scheme is proved secure that the keyword index is indistinguishable under the adaptive keyword
attacks in the general group model, and the ciphertext is selective secure under selective plaintext attacks
in the random oracle model. The security and experimental results show that our scheme is suitable for
practicability.</p>
